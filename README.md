# 🧠 Need2Tool – AI Tool Generator  
From *Need* → to *Tool*. Instantly.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Need2Tool** is a quirky, beginner-friendly AI web app that turns plain English needs into fully functional web tools using AI. Whether you ask for a calculator or a basic to-do list, it instantly generates code and runs it live in your browser.
Built solo by **Rishi** in just 48 hours during **Hack the Vibe 2025**, this project is my very first attempt at vibe-coding through a hackathon.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✍️ **Natural Language Input** – Just describe what you want in plain words.
- ⚡ **Instant Generation** – Get a ready-made HTML/CSS/JS tool in seconds.
- 🧠 **Powered by Together AI (Mixtral-8x7B)** – An open-weight LLM powering the magic.
- 👁 **Live Preview** – See the tool run inside your browser.
- 📋 **Copyable Code** – Grab and use the generated app code anywhere.

## 🧪 Limitations

- 💡 Currently supports only **basic tools** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- ❌ Doesn’t handle complex backend logic, APIs, databases, or state management.
- 🤖 AI output is unpredictable sometimes. It might hallucinate code or misplace tags (still, it’s fun to try!).

⚠️ Note:

This project is hosted on a free Render server, so it may take 30–50 seconds to start up due to inactivity. Please be patient when loading the tool.

The AI may sometimes generate tools or code that aren’t exactly useful for your need — but you can improve your prompt and try again to get a better result.

Experimenting with how you phrase your input can lead to significantly better outputs!

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. You enter a need like:I want a Pomodoro timer.
2. The app sends that to Together AI's API.
3. AI replies with a working HTML+CSS+JS project.
4. We show it live inside an `<iframe>` + give you copyable code.

## 🎓 What I Learned

As a **first-time hackathon participant**, here’s what I figured out along the way:

- 🔑 What API keys are and **how to safely store** them using `.env`
- 🧠 How AI models like Mixtral can help with tool generation
- 🛠 How Node.js and Express.js work to serve frontend + make API calls
- 🤯 How to **not lose my mind** juggling HTML/CSS/JS/backend/AI on a 48-hour solo ride
- 😅 And how to **debug “why isn’t this iframe working” at 2 AM**

Somewhere between typing `.env` wrong and forgetting semicolons, I became... a bit of a backend guy? (Okay, at least I didn't cry this time.)
